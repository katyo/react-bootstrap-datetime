# React Bootstrap DateTime

I implemented it from scratch because I needed deeply customizable date/time selection widget for our [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) powered Web-sites.

Every existing component I've tried at the moment is not tunable enough or too buggy.

This component called **DateTime** works like [React-Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) **Input**. For localized date and time manipulation we uses [MomentJS](http://momentjs.com/), so we support user-defined formats of date and time for values and display.

See demo at [w.illumium.org/datetime](http://w.illumium.org/datetime)
